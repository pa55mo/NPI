        <h2>About Nathan</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is nathan rees but i like people to call me reesy. I am an onboard advisor here at Nerys Powles Industries so i thought i would tell you a little bit about myself. i go to karate every thursday where i am one of the best in my class for my age! when im in karate i like it when my karate teacher tells me to kick because i like to pretend im kicking gino d'campo in the face because i dont like him because hes italian. when im not in karate you will find me online playing in the 50cc mario kart races because i know all the 50cc players are youngsters or newbies so i beat them. i cant wait for the forthcoming year to see what NPI has instore!</p>

<h2>About Nerys</h2>
<p>Hi there im the CEO of Nerys Powles Industries and you might have guessed my name is Nerys Powles. i started this dream with just an idea and twenty seven pounds and it boomed from there. Alot of people ask me what we do here at NPI and i simply tell them we do alot of stuff which includes things and other things. In my spare time when im not making the world a better place i enjoy cleaning, ironing and sorting the house out.

<h2>Lynette Rees</h>
<p>Hi im Lynette and im the newest member here at NPI. I first met Nerys in one of her slag training schemes in 2023 and i was hooked to everything NPI had to offer from then, my only regret is my deer friend Elwyn was still here to benifit from everything this fantastic company has to offer. WOULD I LIE?
